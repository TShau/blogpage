--------------------------------

The AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certification exam is intended for individuals who want to have a foundational knowledge when venturing into the Cloud. Although the AZ-900 test is the easiest to achieve among all the Azure certification exams, you still need to learn and properly understand the concepts on cloud computing, and know the basics on the Azure services.

In the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Exam (or AZ-900 for short), questions will test your ability to:

Describe Cloud Concepts
Describe Core Azure Services
Describe Core Solutions and Management Tools on Azure
Describe Management Tools and Network Security Features
Describe Identity, Governance, Privacy, and Compliance Features
Describe Azure Cost Management and Service Level Agreements
Given the scope of the exam above, you should also be familiar with the concepts of compute, storage, networking, application support, and application development. This guide aims to help you pass your exam on your first try.

## Study Materials
The primary study materials that you can use for your review are: Azure Fundamentals Learning Path, Azure Documentation, Tutorials Dojo’s Azure Cheat Sheets, and our AZ-900 Practice Exams.

Having an Azure account will help you better understand the concepts written within the documentations, since the exam itself contains different types of questions (multiple-choice, drag and drop, hotspot, and dropdown) to test your knowledge on these services.

Additional details regarding your AZ-900 exam can be found in this Azure Exam Skills Outline.

To learn more about each of the AZ-900 exam domains, you can take these free training materials from the Microsoft site:

Explore Microsoft Azure cloud concepts – learn and understand the fundamentals of the Azure platform.
Distinguish Microsoft Azure Core Services – explore the core products and solutions in Azure.
Understand the various management tools from Microsoft Azure – learn how to choose the appropriate tools and services to address different kinds of business challenges.
Securing your data in the cloud – know the security best practices to ensure your resources in the cloud are safe and secured.
Examine Microsoft Azure security, privacy, compliance, and trust –  study the basics of how you can secure access to your applications, the difference between authentication and authorization, and various security tools to protect your account.
Review Microsoft Azure pricing, service level agreements, and lifecycles – explore the factors that affect your cost when using Azure services.

Azure Services to Focus On
Azure offers extensive documentations and various learning paths for all of their services. Knowing the basic concepts and Azure services will help you easily pass the AZ-900 exam, which can pave the way towards a rewarding career in cloud computing. I suggest that you read Tutorials Dojo’s Azure Cheat Sheets, which provide bullet-point summaries of the most important concepts about the different Azure services. 

Concepts that you need to focus on:

Cloud Concepts – You should be able to understand the various concepts in cloud computing, such as benefits, economies of scale, deployment models, and types of cloud services.
Compute – Study the different types of compute services, and their use cases.
Storage – Azure offers many types of storage services, depending on your needs. Understand what these types are and how they differ from each other.
Network – This is the fundamental building block in launching your resources. Study the different types of networking services and the features each of them supports.
Security – Understand how you can secure your account in Azure. You also need to know the various security services that you can use in different scenarios. 
Aside from these, you should know the differences between Azure Portal, CLI, Powershell, and Cloud Shell. It’s also important to familiarize yourself with the portal’s interface since there are questions that show an image of the portal and ask you to select the answer that matches the image.
