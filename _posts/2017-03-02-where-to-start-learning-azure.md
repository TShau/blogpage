When I first started my journey in Azure, I was almost overwhelmed with the vast product landscape that Azure offers. Azure is not just about virtual machines, where you host your applications. If offers many kind of products that help Azure customer's in building their ideal solution. There are aspects like architecture, security, and even compliance that can influence your decision on what Azure products to use. 
It was obvious that diving in without a plan, would result in a tedious learning experience. What I needed was a proper learning path. A great start here was to check out the certifications that Microsoft offers.
