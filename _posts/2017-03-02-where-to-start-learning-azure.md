When I first started my journey in Azure, I was almost overwhelmed with the vast product landscape that Azure offers. Azure is not just about virtual machines, where you host your applications. If offers many kind of products that help Azure customer's in building their ideal solution. There are aspects like architecture, security, and even compliance that can influence your decision on what Azure products to use. 
It was obvious that diving in without a plan, would result in a tedious learning experience. What I needed was a proper learning path. A great start here was to check out the certifications that Microsoft offers.

**What to learn?**   
If you have trouble finding the right learning content, [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/career-paths/) offers learning paths that are categorized per career roles, such as Administrator, Developer or Architect. These career roles also include certifications. In my opinion setting goals for your learning is important to get a grasp on where you are standing and getting motivated on achieving those. For people who are in general new in the technical field, I recommend to check out [Az-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/certifications/azure-fundamentals/?WT.mc_id=modinfra-10582-thmaure).

**How to learn?**    
Each Microsoft Certification offers a dedicated learning path with articles on documentation that will guide you on your journey. Many of those articles include hands-on interactive training for you to gain practical experience.

The learning path there will give you basic insights into cloud concepts, Azure services and its pricing. Microsoft certifications are also recognized in the IT industry, therefore giving you some degree of bragging rights. Something you should consider though, is that it is not about passing the exam, but getting to know what to learn. Passing the exam itself is a nice bonus and should be considered, if your goal is to get extra recognition and benefits when applying for job or possible promotion. 


Last but not least, whats important in your learning journey is to get hands-on practice. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can sign up for a free account with 200$ free credit and 55+ free services.
