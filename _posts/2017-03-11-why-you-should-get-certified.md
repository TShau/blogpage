Before you decide to pursue any certifications, whether you want to specialize in Azure or diversify and go multi-cloud, you should be aware of some common myths that might mislead you about their value and cost.

• Certifications **ARE** a demonstration of knowledge. But they do **NOT** replace the experience of working in the cloud. 
• Certifications **CAN** boost your career. They can help you land an interview or a promotion, but they do **NOT** guarantee you a job. 
• Certifications **ARE** valuable. Better job opportunities equal better salary. But certifications are **NOT** only about money. Certifications are often used to align teams on the same skill level.

Certifications have many benefits. But they don’t mean that you can automatically earn yourself a six-figure salary, by accumulating certifications. In the first place a certificaiton means that you passed a test. But it will not highlight your job experience or any form of of business competency.


Azure has a huge range of products that can help customers build their ideal solution. But when I started learning Azure, I felt daunted by the variety of options. Azure is not just about hosting your applications on virtual machines. You also have to consider architecture, security, and compliance factors when choosing Azure products.

## Which certificate shall I get first?
I realized that I couldn’t just jump in without a plan. I needed a clear learning path. A good place to start was to look at the certifications that Microsoft offers.

First of all, I believe that setting a goal is the best way to motivate yourself to do something. For starters, I think that learning for AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals) exam is a good entry on the Azure world - not only for developers but also for admins, PMs and generally 'business people'. 
However, when it comes to actually spending the exam fee on AZ-900, I would advise you to consider if your learning path ends here, or if you intend to actually target the higher level certifications.


<!--You might have some IT experience. You might have tried AWS, GCP, or Azure. You might think you’re ready to dive in. Hold on. You should probably start with the Azure Fundamentals certification. At best, it will be easy for you. But no matter how far you go in Azure, this cert will lay the groundwork for future success. The next certification on the path is the Azure Administrator Associate, and it can be quite tough. You’ll need all the skills from the Fundamentals cert and a lot of practice with Azure before taking it.-->
