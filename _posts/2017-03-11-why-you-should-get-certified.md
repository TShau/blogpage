Before you decide to pursue any certifications, whether you want to specialize in Azure or diversify and go multi-cloud, you should be aware of some common myths that might mislead you about their value and cost.

• Certifications **ARE** a demonstration of knowledge. But they do **NOT** replace the experience of working in the cloud. 
• Certifications **CAN** boost your career. They can help you land an interview or a promotion, but they do **NOT** guarantee you a job. 
• Certifications **ARE** valuable. Better job opportunities equal better salary. But certifications are **NOT** only about money. Certifications are often used to align teams on the same skill level.

Certifications have many benefits. But they don’t mean that you can automatically earn yourself a six-figure salary, by accumulating certifications. In the first place a certificaiton means that you passed a test. But it will not highlight your job experience or any form of of business competency.


Azure has a huge range of products that can help customers build their ideal solution. But when I started learning Azure, I felt daunted by the variety of options. Azure is not just about hosting your applications on virtual machines. You also have to consider architecture, security, and compliance factors when choosing Azure products.

## Which certificate shall I get first?
I realized that I couldn’t just jump in without a plan. I needed a clear learning path. A good place to start was to look at the certifications that Microsoft offers.

First of all, I believe that setting a goal is the best way to motivate yourself to do something. For starters, I think that learning for AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals) exam is a good entry on the Azure world - not only for developers but also for admins, PMs and generally 'business people'. 

## Certification levels
There are four different levels of certificaitons, arranged from beginner to expert. 
The before mentioned AZ-900 exam belongs to the **Fundamentals** level certification. It is targetted to anyone starting to learn cloud computing and Azure as a product in general. I only recommend to spend the exam fee on this exam, only if the fundamentals certification is your end goal.
If you intend to target a higher level certification, I advice to skip this exam and continue with the next level.

The **Associate** level is targetted towards administrators who have a fundamental understanding in IT and virtual computing. This is the perfect level for an IT professional, who is looking for stepping into the world of Azure. 
The **Expert** level is targeted to professionals, which prior experience on Azure. While the required exams can be taken as you want, the certificaton itself can only be obtained, if you already got a related certification of the previous level. E.g. For **Azure Solutions Architect Expert**, you need the certification **Azure Administrator Associate** and the completion of the exam **AZ-305**

## Conclusion
If you have interests in making a career with Microsoft Azure, I highly recommend to get one of the above mentioned certifications.
