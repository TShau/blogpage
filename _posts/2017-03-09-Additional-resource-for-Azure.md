As a continuation from the previous article [Where to start learning azure](https://tommyshau.com/azure/where-to-start-learning-azure/).

There are more resource that I recommend to get a moderate understanding on Microsoft Azure.
While those resources are recommended to learn after getting a foundational knowledge base, I also think it is a good idea to check out all the things that you are able to do with Azure.

• [Get started guide for Azure developers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/browse/?expanded=azure&products=azure-resource-manager)– Get practice by deploying example resources through Azure Resource Manager templates. A useful library not only for practical learning but also for staring your cloud infrastructure.

## Azure Architecture and Cloud Concepts
