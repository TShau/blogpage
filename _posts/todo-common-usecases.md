## 10 Common Use Cases of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is an awesome way to swiftly build I.T infrastructures that can scale anytime. Big businesses and corporations hopped on the cloud train long ago, and they credit their success to relying on cloud services. Fun fact: Most of the apps you're probably using today are powered by the cloud!

This article outlines the typical uses of cloud computing and shows why it's a game-changer in the IT industry.

1. Storage
This is probably the most common use case for cloud computing. Nowadays, swapping out your local hard drives for cloud-based storage is becoming the new norm in IT solutions. Cloud storage is awesome for storing massive amounts of data since it offers practically unlimited storage. This means that you can store as much data as you want without having to worry about running out of physical space. Plus, since cloud storage is built with redundancy, it also ensures high availability for mission-critical workloads and applications. 

2. Backup and Disaster Recovery
Cloud computing is an excellent choice for creating backup copies of vital data, including customer records, financials, and other critical information. This ensures the safety and security of everything stored. Moreover, cloud storage solutions offer built-in disaster recovery capabilities. In the event of a natural disaster or data breach, you can swiftly restore your systems and resume operations without any delay.
Imagine running a business from a local data center that you control. To protect customer data, you back it up and send it off-site to another location. But what if disaster strikes and your data center is engulfed in flames, rendering your business inoperable? Rebuilding your IT infrastructure with the backed-up data alone can take weeks, if not months. And in the business world, every hour lost translates to lost revenue.
Therefore leveraging the capabilities of the cloud to build a backup location is critical to avoid any disaster scenario.

3. High Performing Applications
In today's business landscape, having high-performing applications is paramount, especially with the advent of 5G technology. The need for speed has never been more critical. A slow application can spell doom for your business in this fast-paced environment. However, fret not! With the aid of cloud computing, even small businesses can compete toe-to-toe with larger organizations when it comes to system performance. Moreover, scalability is seamlessly woven into the fabric of the cloud, alleviating any concerns about your organization's growth.

4. Serverless Computing
Serverless computing is akin to a remarkable superpower bestowed upon us by the cloud. It empowers you to execute functions on computers managed by renowned cloud service providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure. From the perspective of a client, the burden of setting up and provisioning computers becomes a thing of the past. The cloud takes charge of crucial aspects like system updates, scalability, and high availability effortlessly. And the cherry on top? You only pay for the precise duration your function runs and the resources it consumes. Imagine processing logs for a mere 5 minutes every week. Instead of having a computer running around the clock, you are billed solely for the actual execution time of your function. This not only conserves energy but also slashes operating costs significantly.

5. Test and Development
In the cloud, you have the flexibility to effortlessly toggle between different environments. Unlike traditional servers, the cloud empowers you to create, deploy, and terminate environments at your convenience. Gone are the days of waiting for environment provisioning. With just a few clicks, you can swiftly establish a staging environment to explore your project's proof of concept. This expedites your product's time to market, driving substantial business growth.

6. IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service
Choosing the right computer specifications and network bandwidth for your business can be a daunting task. Not to mention the additional expenses like backup storage, rental fees, and the dreaded electricity bill. However, the cloud eliminates these burdens, allowing you to focus on what truly matters - your business objectives. When starting on the cloud, you can begin with a small instance and seamlessly scale up as your business grows. Furthermore, if your servers remain idle, you can simply shut down some of them to reduce costs. No longer will you have to deal with the complexities of building and managing your own data center and physical servers. Trade your Capital Expenses for Operational Expenses and pay only for what you truly utilize.

7. AI as a service ( AIaaS )
Cloud computing makes it possible for anyone to reap the benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) without needing a Data Science degree. Take, for example, a web developer who can create a facial recognition app using their web development skills alone. In the cloud, AI is available as a service accessed through an API. By automating repetitive tasks, AI saves time and reduces personnel costs. Moreover, it empowers businesses to make faster and more accurate decisions by leveraging predictive capabilities based on past datasets.

8. Hybrid Infrastructure
A hybrid cloud solution can be likened to a carefully curated mixtape, combining the best of both a private network and a public cloud. It's not always necessary to migrate your entire IT infrastructure to the cloud. Instead, you can choose to keep the core components of your business on-site while leveraging the cloud for those spontaneous tasks.

9. Building Fault Tolerant Systems
In 2008, Netflix encountered a major setback when a database corruption halted their DVD shipments. However, they swiftly transformed this challenge into an opportunity by relocating their operations center to the cloud. Why? Because cloud-based applications possess the remarkable ability to persist even in the face of adversity. Moreover, data stored in the cloud is replicated, ensuring that if one server falters, a mirrored copy can seamlessly take its place. This exemplifies the essence of fault-tolerant systems, which safeguard a company's invaluable resources - data, applications, and networks - against unforeseen catastrophes. In today's business landscape, where any downtime can result in substantial financial losses, the significance of fault tolerance cannot be overstated. Hence, cloud solutions are progressively emerging as the preferred choice.

10. Security
Utilizing the power of the cloud can greatly enhance the security and integrity of your data. Migrating your apps to the cloud offers the remarkable advantage of accessing super secure data centers. Additionally, by storing your data offsite, you eliminate the risks associated with theft or mismanagement, ensuring its safety.
Furthermore, the ability to access your data from anywhere at any time grants you greater control over who can access it. You have the option to implement role-based authentication, which allows you to restrict user access based on your desired level of security. This feature not only strengthens accountability within the organization but also ensures compliance with regulations.
