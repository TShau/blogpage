# About Tommy 

<!--- foto-->

For over 10 years I have been working on the IT industry, fostering my passion as a tinker, building awesome stuff and occasionally publishing my work on the web.
I graduated in electrical engineering at the **Technical University in Munich** majoring in Machine Learning and Human Machine Interaction. 

Today I work at **Microsoft**, Germany as a Partner Technical Advisor on the Azure Team. 
On most of my days, I assist our customer support team on troubleshooting complex technical problems regarding Azure Cloud Services, Api Management, Azure Policy, and Storage. My role at Microsoft enables me to work in a broad spectrum of technologies that go into areas like system architecture, as well as web development.
